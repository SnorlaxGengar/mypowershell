my powershell configuration and themes

tehrob-x.psm1 is the theme modified from oh-my-posh.
I change the prompt to:

> Gengar Weekend:[-2.03:28:53.9949940] Off duty:[-03:28:54]
> ~
> $

first line is : Username+time remain to weekend+time remain to off duty,
second line is path, third line is $ or #(if Administrator)
